echo '.zlogin: This should be read fourth (login) - will not be read with new shells on Linux'

# Sourced in login shells. Should contain commands to be executed only in
# login shells. Not the place for alias definitions, environment variable
# settings, etc.; as a general rule, should not change the shell
# environment at all. Should be used to set the terminal type and run
# external commands (fortune, msgs, etc).
